In short, you can upload a sketch and a reference, and just click colorize.

What is important is that your reference image will become a color picker once it is uploaded. You can select any color via clicking your reference image and give hint to the AI via clicking your sketch, just like paintschainer.

Just click the reference and then make some pointed hints on your sketch.

You can give the AI many hints like this.

But keep in mind that the AI is very sensitive to your hints. In most cases, a single and small point is fine. You do not need to so much some messy hints to cover sketch blocks. Small and pointed hints are recommended.

These 4 toggles are very important.

In some cases, shifting these toggles will make a big improvement in colorization.

So we recommend you try all of these V1, V2, V3, V4 for your sketches.

Good luck and have fun.
