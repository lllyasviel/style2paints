Basicly speaking, you can control the color and the direction of the light in the **Rendering Mode**.

We also provide more possibility for you to change the light and shadow.

You can communicate with AI using these two hints:

![imgs](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints/raw/master/imgs/17.png)

*These two signals are borrowed from Physics, where scientists use these two signals to describe magnetic field.*

You can mark **foreground** with circles, while marking **background** with crosses.

**Note that you do NOT need to mask anything in most cases.** 

Our AI will do all things for you. You only need to give some hints when the AI is wrong.
